# FriendFinder

FriendFinder is a website will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

* FriendFinder is not complete. 

* Points that are complete
    * HTML
    * Server js
    * Routing js

* Points that are incomplete
    * Modal
        * So far, I have not had the chance to get this to work, I have some starter code for it
    * Match criteria
        * Goal is to have forEach loops that will calculate the match between the scores array between the Friends and the user entry
